    "text": "Understanding autograder error messages\nWhen you pass a test, you’ll see a nice message and a cute emoji!\n\n\n\nWhen you don’t, however, the message can be a little confusing.\n\n\n\n\nThe best course of action is to find the test case that failed and use that as a starting point to debug your code.\n\n\n\nIn the example above, we see that the test case in green, max_swing in set(bus['name']), is not passing. The actual output (in blue) is often hard to parse, so the best course of action is to:\n\nMake a new (temporary) cell after the grader.check(...) cell. Please do not make a new cell in between the given code cell and the grader.check(...) cell, as it could mess with the results.\nCopy and paste the failing test case into your temporary cell and run it.\n\nIf it’s giving you an error like in the example above, look at the last line of the error and use the Debugging Guide’s search functionality in the top left menu to find the corresponding guide.\nIf it’s not giving you an error, it’ll likely give you an output like False. This means that your code does not cause an error (yay!), but it returns an incorrect output. In these casses, inspect each individual element of the test case. The example above checks if max_swing is in set(bus['name']), so it might be a good idea to display both variables and do a visual check.\nIf you’re still having issues, post on Ed!\n\nAfter your grader.check(...) passes, feel free to delete the temporary cell.\n\n\n\nWhy do I get an error saying “grader is not defined”?\nIf it has been a while since you’ve worked on an assignment, the kernel will shut itself down to preserve memory. When this happens, all of your variables are forgotten, including the grader. That’s OK. The easiest way to fix this is by restarting your kernel and rerunning all the cells. To do this, in the top left menu, click Kernel -&gt; Restart and Run All Cells.\n\n\nI’m positive I have the right answer, but the test fails. Is there a mistake in the test?\nWhile you might see the correct answer displayed as the result of the cell, chances are your solution isn’t being stored in the answer variable. Make sure you are assigning the result to the answer variable and that there are no typos in the variable name. Finally, restart your kernel and run all the cells in order: Kernel -&gt; Restart and Run All Cells.\n\n\nWhy does the last grader.export cell fail if all previous tests passed?\nThis can happen if you “overwrite” a variable that is used in a question. For instance, say Question 1 asks you to store your answer in a variable named stat and, later on in the notebook, you change the value of stat; the test right after Question 1 will pass, but the test at the end of the notebook will fail. It is good programming practice to give your variables informative names and to avoid repeating the same variable name for more than one purpose.\n\n\nWhy does a notebook test fail now when it passed before, and I didn’t change my code?\nYou probably ran your notebook out of order. Re-run all previous cells in order, which is how your code will be graded.",

Thus, it is imperative that you stay on the submission page until the autograder finishes running, and the results are displayed.\n\nWhy did a Gradescope test fail when all the Jupyter notebook’s tests passed?\nThis can happen if you’re running your notebook’s cells out of order. The autograder runs your notebook from top-to-bottom. If you’re defining a variable at the bottom of your notebook and using it at the top, the Gradescope autograder will fail because it doesn’t recognize the variable when it encounters it.\nThis is why we recommend going into the top left menu and clicking Kernel -&gt; Restart -&gt; Run All. The autograder “forgets” all of the variables and runs the notebook from top-to-bottom like the Gradescope autograder does. This will highlight any issues.\nFind the first cell that raises an error. Make sure that all of the variables used in that cell have been defined above that cell, and not below.\n\n\nWhy do I get a NameError: name ___ is not defined when I run a grader check?\nThis happens when you try to access a variable that has not been defined yet. Since the autograder runs all the cells in-order, if you happened to define a variable in a cell further down and accessed it before that cell, the autograder will likely throw this error. Another reason this could occur is because the notebook was not saved before the autograder tests are run. When in doubt, it is good practice to restart your kernel, run all the cells again, and save the notebook before running the cell that causes this error.\n\n\nMy autograder keeps running/timed out\nIf your Gradescope submission page has been stuck running on this page for a while:\n\n\n\nor if it times out:\n\n\n\nit means that the Gradescope autograder failed to execute in the expected amount of time. This could be due to an inefficiency in your code or a problem on Gradescope’s end, so we recommend resubmitting and letting the autograder rerun. It is your responsibility to ensure that the autograder runs properly, and, if it still fails, to follow up by making a private Ed post.",

Continuing the same example, this looks like elections.groupby('Year').agg({'Popular vote' : 'mean').\n\n\n\nTypeError: 'NoneType' object is not subscriptable / AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'shape'\nThis usually occurs as you assign a None value to a variable, then try to either index into or access some attribute of that variable. For Python functions like append and extend, you do not need to do any variable assignment because they mutate the variable directly and return None. Assigning None tends to happen as a result of code like:\nsome_list = some_list.append(element)\nIn contrast, an operation like np.append does not mutate the variable in place and, instead, returns a copy. In these cases, (re)assignment is necessary:\nsome_array = np.append(some_array, element)\n\n\nTypeError: 'int'/'float' object is not subscriptable\nThis occurs when you try and index into an integer or other numeric Python data type. It can be confusing to debug amidst a muddle of code, but you can use the error message to identify which variable is causing this error. Using type(var_name) to check the data type of the variable in question can be a good starting point.",

However, it is slightly different in that scalar variables come up in the context of NumPy data types which have slightly different attributes.\nFor a concrete example, if you defined\nnumpy_arr = np.array([1])\nand indexed into it twice (numpy_arr[0][0]), you would get the above error. Unlike a Python integer whose type is int, type(numpy_arr[0]) returns the NumPy version of an integer, numpy.int64. Additionally, you can check the data type by accessing the .dtype attribute of NumPy array (numpy_arr.dtype) or scalar variable (numpy_arr[0].dtype).\n\n\nIndexError: index _ is out of bounds for axis _ with size _\nThis error usually happens when you try to index a value that’s greater than the size of the array/list/DataFrame/Series. For example,\nsome_list = [2, 4, 6, 8]\nsome_list has a length of 4. Trying some_list[6] will error because index 6 is greater than the length of the array. Note that some_list[4] will also cause an IndexError because Python and pandas uses zero indexing, which means that the first element has index 0, the second element has index 1, etc.; some_list[4] would grab the fifth element, which is impossible when the list only has 4 elements.",

The fix is to use bitwise operators |, &, ~ , respectively, to allow for element-wise comparisons between values in arrays or Series.\nAlternatively, these errors could emerge due to overwriting Python keywords like bool and sum that may be used in the autograder tests, similar to what’s described here. You should follow a similar procedure of identifying the line of code erroring, checking if you’ve overwritten any Python keywords using Ctrl+F, and renaming those variables to something more informative before restarting your kernel and running the erroring tests again.\n\n\nValueError: Can only compare identically-labeled Series objects\nAs the message would suggest, this error occurs when comparing two Series objects that have different lengths. You can double check the lengths of the Series using len(series_name) or series_name.size.\n\n\nValueError: -1 is not in range / KeyError: -1\nThis error occurs when you try and index into a Series or DataFrame as you would a Python list. Unlike a list where passing an index of -1 gives the last element, pandas interprets df[-1] as an attempt to find the row corresponding to index -1 (that is, df.loc[-1]). If your intention is to pick out the last row in df, consider using integer-position based indexing by doing df.iloc[-1]. In general, to avoid ambiguity in these cases, it is also good practice to write out both the row and column indices you want with df.iloc[-1, :].",
