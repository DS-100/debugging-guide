## Shortcuts for Cells

For the following commands, make sure you're in command mode. You can enter this mode by pressing `esc`.

- `a`: create a cell above
- `b`: create a cell below
- `dd`: delete current cell
- `m`: convert a cell to markdown (text cell)
- `y`: convert a cell to code 

## Running Cells

For individual cells, 

- `ctrl` + `return`: run the current cell
- `shift` + `return`: run the current cell and move to the next cell

To run all cells in a notebook: 

- In the menu bar on the left, click `Run`. From here, you have several options. The ones we use most commonly are:

    - `Run All Above Selected Cell`: this runs every cell above the selected cell 
    - `Run Selected Cell and All Below`: this runs the selected cell and all cells below
    - `Run All`: this runs every cell in the notebook from top-to-bottom
